Darwin's understanding of evolution and nineteenth-century scholars studying the history of  texts shared the idea of a "family tree." Both viewed the variation that appeared over time as a series of branches, each forking from a single source. Today biologists and textual scholars are exploring more complex relationships. The genealogies and descent of both biological species and of texts show networks of connections not limited to a rigid tree structure.

This course will introduce some standard approaches to modeling and comparing digital corpora of texts, and consider how we can apply methods from disciplines like computational biology to reconstruct and interpret their transmission.   Students will gain practical experience using computational methods to address important questions for anyone interested in understanding a digital corpus. How do we identify literary style?  How do we isolate texts or sections of texts with particular subject matter? How do we recognize relations among many texts, or texts in different languages?

There are no prerequisites, and no background of any kind is assumed.
